# Amuze — Regional OTT & Learning Platform

## Product Overview

Amuze was built as a **regional content platform** that combined:
- On-demand video (OTT)
- Structured learning content
- Creator-led programming

The product focused on **vernacular-first consumption**, addressing audiences underserved by mainstream English and Hindi-centric platforms.

Amuze was designed to operate within real bandwidth, device, and cost constraints typical of Indian users.

## Problem Context

At the time of development:
- Regional creators lacked distribution and monetisation
- Learning content was fragmented and informal
- OTT platforms optimised for scale, not depth or learning outcomes

Amuze attempted to unify **entertainment + education** in a single consumer journey.

## Platform Components

### 1. OTT Video Platform
- On-demand video playback
- Regional language focus
- Mobile-first consumption patterns
- Content categorisation by genre and format

### 2. Learning & Skill Content

This later evolved into **Learn From Home**, a distinct learning layer.

## Learn From Home (LMS Layer)

Learn From Home functioned as:
- A lightweight LMS

- Focused on accessibility rather than formal certification

Key characteristics:

---

## Product & Ops Challenges

- Content acquisition and quality control
- Balancing entertainment and learning use-cases
- Monetisation in regional markets
- Creator onboarding and retention
- Infrastructure costs vs low ARPU users

The platform required tight coordination between:
- Content teams
- Tech delivery
- Creator relationships
- User growth operations

## My Role

I was responsible for:
- Product definition and roadmap
- Platform architecture decisions
- Content workflow design
- Learning platform structuring
- Bridging content, tech, and operations

This was an end-to-end product ownership role.

## Key Learnings

- Regional platforms require ops-led product design
- Learning adoption depends on trust, not features
- Creator ecosystems need incentives, not dashboards
- Creators nature drives the learners adoption
- Infra costs define product constraints early

Amuze reinforced the importance of building for **real users, real devices, and real economics**.
